* [Plotly](https://github.com/plotly) - The interactive graphing library for Python
* [Seaborn](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn) - Statistical data visualization in Python
* [Bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh) - Interactive Data Visualization in the browser, from Python
* [PyGWalker](https://github.com/Kanaries/pygwalker) - PyGWalker: Turn your pandas dataframe into a Tableau-style User Interface for visual analysis

## Natural Language Processing

*Projects for Natural Language Processing.*

* [NLTK](https://github.com/nltk/nltk) - NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a suite of open source Python modules, data sets, and tutorials supporting research and development in Natural Language Processing.

## Scientific Computing

*Projects for Scientific Computing.*

* [Numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy)- The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
* [Scipy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy)- SciPy library main repository

## Statistics

* [Pingouin](https://github.com/raphaelvallat/pingouin) - Statistical package in Python based on Pandas

## Time Series

*Projects for Time Series.*

* [Orbit](https://github.com/uber/orbit) - A Python package for Bayesian forecasting with object-oriented design and probabilistic models under the hood.
* [Skrime](https://github.com/sktime/sktime) - A unified framework for machine learning with time series
* [Darts](https://github.com/unit8co/darts) - A python library for user-friendly forecasting and anomaly detection on time series.
* [Prophet](https://github.com/facebook/prophet) - Tool for producing high quality forecasts for time series data that has multiple seasonality with linear or non-linear growth.
* [Kats](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Kats) - Kats, a kit to analyze time series data, a lightweight, easy-to-use, generalizable, and extendable framework to perform time series analysis, from understanding the key statistics and characteristics, detecting change points and anomalies, to forecasting future trends.
